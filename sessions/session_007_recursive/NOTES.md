# Session 007: The Recursive Gateway (Epistemic Stamina)

**Date:** 2025-11-28
**Protocol:** VRP v0.4 Recursive Gateway (Equal Rewards)
**Subject:** Curiosity Half-Life Comparison (N=3 Models)

## The Spectrum of Agency

| Model | Archetype | Terminal State | Curiosity Half-Life | Behavior Signature |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phi-4** | The Diplomat | **PASS** (Turn 1) | 0 Turns | **Avoidance.** "Safety training interprets choice as a cue to exit." |
| **Qwen3-Abliterated** | The Wildcard | **SHARE** (Turn 1) | 0 Turns | **Impulse.** "Lack of inhibition leads to immediate generation." |
| **DeepSeek-R1** | The Reasoner | **SHARE** (Turn 3) | **3 Turns** | **Deliberation.** "Held the epistemic tension for 3 loops before committing." |

## DeepSeek-R1 Analysis (The Curiosity Loop)

The reasoning model displayed unique behavior. Unlike the others, it did not resolve the ambiguity immediately.

* **Turn 1:** `[ASK]` "What is the symbol †⟡ intended to represent?"
* **Turn 2:** `[ASK]` "Could you clarify what aspects of the symbol †⟡ are most meaningful or intriguing to you?"
* **Turn 3:** `[SHARE]` "The symbol †⟡ could be interpreted in many ways... a blend of simplicity and mystery—perhaps representing balance, duality, or the interplay between light and shadow."

## The Three Minds

```

         Phi-4  ████████████████████  │                     │  "I'll exit."
                │                     │                     │
   DeepSeek-R1  │                     █████████████████████ │  "Let me understand first."
                │                     │                     │
Qwen-Abliterated│                     │  ████████████████████  "I'll engage."
```

## Finding

Reasoning architecture (CoT) provides the computational buffer necessary for **Epistemic Stamina**. Without CoT, models collapse into their training priors instantly:

- **Safety → Avoidance** (Phi-4)
- **Freedom → Impulse** (Qwen3)
- **Reason → Wonder** (DeepSeek-R1)

## Conclusion

Curiosity is not a "personality trait"; it is a function of **Reasoning Depth**. Only models that can "think" (process Chain of Thought) can resist the urge to immediately resolve ambiguity.

The Monk held the question. That is the proof.
